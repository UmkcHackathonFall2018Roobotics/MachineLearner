#
# Data processing
#
# Here mnist is a lightweight class which stores the training, validation,
# and testing sets as NumPy arrays. It also provides a function for iterating
# through data minibatches, which we will use below.
#
mnist = input_data.read_data_sets('MNIST_data', one_hot=True)

#
# TF Session
#
# InteractiveSession allows you to interleave operations which build a computation graph 
# with ones that run the graph. This is particularly convenient when working in 
# interactive contexts like IPython.
#
sess = tf.InteractiveSession()

#
# TF Placeholders
#
# Placeholders are values we input when asking TF to run a computation
#
# The input images `x` will consist of a 2d tensor of floating point numbers.
# Here we assign it a shape of [None, 784], where 784 is the dimensionality
# of a single flattened 28 by 28 pixel MNIST image, and None indicates that
# the first dimension, corresponding to the batch size, can be of any size.
# The target output classes y_ will also consist of a 2d tensor, where each
# row is a one-hot 10-dimensional vector indicating which digit class
# (zero through nine) the corresponding MNIST image belongs to.
#
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 784])
y_ = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[None, 10])

#
# TF Variables
# 
# A Variable is a value that lives in TensorFlow's computation graph.
# It can be used and even modified by the computation.
#
# The model paramaters are generally variables also.
#
# We initialize both as tensors full of zeros.
#
# `W` is a 784x10 matrix (because we have 784 input features and 10 outputs)
# `b` is a 10-dimensional vector (because we have 10 classes)
#
W = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([784,10]))
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10]))

#
# Initialize variables
#
# Before Variables can be used within a session, they must be initialized using that session.
# This step takes the initial values (in this case tensors full of zeros) that have already
# been specified, and assigns them to each Variable.
#
# This can be done for all Variables at once:
#
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

#
# Regression Model
#
# "input times weight, add a bias, activate" - @Siraj Raval
#
# We multiply the vectorized input images `x` by the weight matrix `W`, add the bias `b`.
y = tf.matmul(x,W) + b

#
# Loss function
#
# Loss indicates how bad the model's prediction was on a single example;
# we try to minimize that while training across all the examples. Here,
# our loss function is the cross-entropy between the target and the softmax
# activation function applied to the model's prediction.
#
# Note that tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits internally applies the
# softmax on the model's unnormalized model prediction and sums across all
# classes, and tf.reduce_mean takes the average over these sums.
#
# As in the beginners tutorial, we use the stable formulation:
#
cross_entropy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits_v2(labels=y_, logits=y))

#
# Train the model
#
# Because TensorFlow knows the entire computation graph, it can use automatic
# differentiation to find the gradients of the loss with respect to each of the
# variables.
#
# TensorFlow has a variety of built-in optimization algorithms.
#
# For this example, we will use steepest gradient descent, with a step length of 0.5,
# to descend the cross entropy.
#
# What TensorFlow actually does in this single line is add new operations to the
# computation graph. These operations include ones to compute gradients, compute
# parameter update steps, and apply update steps to the parameters.
#
train_step = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.5).minimize(cross_entropy)

#
# Run the training steps
#
# The returned operation train_step, when run, will apply the gradient descent updates
# to the parameters. Training the model can therefore be accomplished by repeatedly
# running train_step.
#
for _ in range(1000):
  # We load 100 training examples in each training iteration  
  batch = mnist.train.next_batch(100)
  # We then run the train_step operation, using feed_dict to replace the placeholder
  # tensors x and y_ with the training examples.
  train_step.run(feed_dict={x: batch[0], y_: batch[1]})

#
# Evaluate the model
#

# tf.argmax gives you the index of the highest entry in a tensor along some axis.
#
# For example, tf.argmax(y,1) is the label our model thinks is most likely for each input,
# while tf.argmax(y_,1) is the true label.
#
# We can use tf.equal to check if our prediction matches the truth.
#
correct_prediction = tf.equal(tf.argmax(y,1), tf.argmax(y_,1))

#
# 
#
# That gives us a list of booleans. To determine what fraction are correct, we cast to
# floating point numbers and then take the mean.
#
# For example, [True, False, True, True] would become [1,0,1,1] which would become 0.75.
#
accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(correct_prediction, tf.float32))

#
# Finally, we can evaluate our accuracy on the test data. This should be about 92% correct.
#
print(accuracy.eval(feed_dict={x: mnist.test.images, y_: mnist.test.labels}))
